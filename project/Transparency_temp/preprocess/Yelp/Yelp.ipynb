       " 'So after a ridiculous weekend  I decided there was absolutely no way I was doing anything today besides watching Real Housewifes of New Jersey and ordering chinese food. I actually managed to find 2 separate delivery menus, but ended up ordering from Asia Lee because they were cheaper and had a lower minimum delivery requirement. I also appreciated the \\\\\"New York Style\\\\\" note on the menu. An Arizona restaurant serving food from another country in the style of another state. It reminded me of a dream I had where I was the lead singer of a Green Day cover band that only did Journey songs, but in the style of Green Day. BTW, I\\'m totally starting that band.\\\\n\\\\nI got hot and sour soup, kung pao chicken, and an eggroll. They\\'re all sitting in front of me right now. Well, except the egg roll. That barely made it out of the bag.  The hot and sour soup is okay, but has too many undercooked carrots and not enough tofu.  The broth is a little weird too. If you like hot and sour soup, you might need to manage your expectations here.  Kung pao chicken is my go-to chinese entree because I need heat in my food or I feel like I\\'m not really eating. The heat is definitely lacking here, and I forgot to ask for Siracha. The lo mein is okay but also a little bland.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m still eating it, but not as quickly as I should be, because it\\'s not that good. Plus, it\\'s hard to eat while simultaneously being sickened by the atrocious hair on Real Housewifes of New Jersey. But that\\'s not Asia Lee\\'s fault. Two stars.',\n",

       " \"Not surprised at ALL that I ended up at a Mexican place for the second time before heading home from Vegas.  I do what I want!!\\\\n\\\\nIt was a Sunday and the football game was on, so it was pretty lively in there.  The service was a bit slow, but oh well.  Chips and salsa - for FREE - was a nice change from the other Mexican place we tried (Yolos @ Planet Hollywood), and the salsa had a nice smoky flavor to it.  \\\\n\\\\nMy chicken tortilla soup was just how I like it - good amount of broth-to-food ratio and everything was super flavorful - I looooove my cilantro, that's for sure! Chicken was nice and tender.  We also shared an appetizer of chicken taquitos, which also had a nice blast of flavor and topped with some deeeeeelicous cheese.  \\\\n\\\\nGood pick if you want something more on the casual side.\",\n",
       " \"If you call with questions about adoptions, they will NEVER answer the phone. You get hold music forever. I waited 20 minutes after the machine said the wait time is around 1 minute. I've called 3 times trying to get info on how to adopt a new stray I saw there... Have never gotten through. It's a long drive for me so it's very inconvenient for me to travel there just to get some questions answered.\\\\n\\\\nI would say around 60% if the dogs are not adoptable. They are either quarantined or strays that have to go through a waiting period. You can almost never find someone to help you look at a dog or answer questions. You can't put any dogs on hold to adopt when they become available. \\\\n\\\\nI entered a drawing for a stray puppy that became available and it was extremely fishy, pulling a number out of the box but instead of reading the winning number the lady went to the back room for a few minutes and then came out and told us some guy in another city won the dog... He wasn't even there.\\\\n\\\\nI went to the back to request to walk one of the other dogs and, before I could make my request, the guy closed the door on me and I waited for about 15 minutes in the sun before he opened the door to take my request. There was around 4 others in line.\\\\n\\\\nI did want to say that once they gave me the dog to play with, they have these nice play cages out back around the corner where you can throw a ball or chew toy and stuff. This is the only thing stopping it from being 1 star.\\\\n\\\\nI would say there's an extremely minimal effort being put in to actually find these animals homes. It could be so much better.\",\n",

       " 'My husband and I stayed here during the Memorial Day weekend.  Overall, the hotel is very nice--rooms are well appointed, nice big shower with a bench, dark wood cabinetry, plenty of space to hang and store your clothes.  Also a cool thing in the room was digital, from opening the curtains to turning on the AC to turning off the bathroom lights, even turning on the light for housekeeping!\\\\n\\\\nThe room is small and so is the bathroom.  It\\'s nice there is a separate area for the toilet, but it\\'s separated by frosted glass, which by the way, you can still see through.  It was a good thing it was just me and the hubby.  I would not recommend this room for a group of people.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, this hotel (like all the other hotels in City Center) is very far from the other casinos like Caesar\\'s Palace or Venetian.  Even if you want to walk to Planet Hollywood, you would have to walk out of the hotel, down the stairs, then upstairs again, then downstairs again.\\\\n\\\\nAnother downside to this hotel was that on our 2nd night staying there, housekeeping never made up the room.  We left the room around 11 a.m. on the 2nd day we were there, came back around 3 p.m. and found the room was not made (even though the light for housekeeping was on the whole time).  I figured, it\\'s only 3 p.m., and we\\'re leaving in a couple of minutes so no big deal--our room will get serviced later when we get back.  Around 7 when we returned, still nothing.  I finally had to call the front desk and let them know.  They immediately asked if I had the service light on, and I said yes, \\\\\"All Day.\\\\\"  She said she would let housekeeping know right away.  My room was eventually serviced, but you would never expect something like this at the other hotels (like Palazzo or Bellagio).\\\\n\\\\nOverall, it\\'s nice to stay at the new hotels but there are nicer hotels with better service on the strip.',\n",
